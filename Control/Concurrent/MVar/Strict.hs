-- Note: we use 'force' in many places one might expect to find `rnf` instead, and
-- @force x `seq`@ where one might expect to see @deepseq@. This ensures that the
-- value is forced to WHNF whether or not its NFData instance does so, and also
-- ensures that the compiler knows this is the case.

-- |Put a value into an 'MVar'.  If the 'MVar' is currently full,
-- 'putMVar' will wait until it becomes empty.
--
-- There are two further important properties of 'putMVar':
--
--   * 'putMVar' is single-wakeup.  That is, if there are multiple
--     threads blocked in 'putMVar', and the 'MVar' becomes empty,
--     only one thread will be woken up.  The runtime guarantees that
--     the woken thread completes its 'putMVar' operation.
--
--   * When multiple threads are blocked on an 'MVar', they are
--     woken up in FIFO order.  This is useful for providing
--     fairness properties of abstractions built using 'MVar's.

  Take a value from an 'MVar', put a new value into the 'MVar' and

  happens but before the put does.
